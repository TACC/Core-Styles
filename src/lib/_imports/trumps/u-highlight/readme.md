To style the highlighting behind text.
**Use Cases:**
- The hero image text on the [TACC homepage](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/)

`display: inline` is required to keep highlight behind text only, instead of filling the container the text is within. 

Note: Adjust to narrow width to test highlighting.
