label: Mailto Link Text Replacement
notes: |-
  Replaces the display text of an `<a href="mailto:â€¦" data-user="bob" data-domain="">` link with the e-mail address constructed from the `data-user` and `data-domain` attributes.

  This can be used to render an accurate e-mail that will not be recognized by a generic web scraper. The default display text should be an inaccurate e-mail address.

  _To make sure link is accessible if CSS does not load, make it obvious to humans what part of an e-mail is inaccurate, e.g. `__REMOVE_THIS__`._
