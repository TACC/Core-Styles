Bootstrap Dropdown
==================

Styles for Bootstrap dropdowns that provide consistent TACC theming across all clients.

These styles restore the dropdown theming that was previously only available within headers.

## Usage

Apply TACC dropdown styling to any Bootstrap dropdown by including `bootstrap.dropdown.css` in your stylesheet imports.

## Features

- Consistent font sizing that inherits from parent context
- TACC-themed padding for dropdown menu and items
- Proper color theming for normal, hover, active, and disabled states
- Compatible with all Bootstrap dropdown variants

## Migration Note

These styles replace the header-scoped dropdown styles that were previously in `s-header.css` and `s-header.bootstrap.css`.
