A block or list of links that each have an image.

The grid supports, without change to layout:

- large and small images
- markup with or without `<ul>` and `<li>`'s

The grid supports user input to change layout:

- `--row-height`: row height (hint: `1fr` gives equal-height rows)
- `--min-width`: minimum width (the smallest width for an image)
- `--max-cols`: maximum columns (the maximum number of columns)
