## Execution Order

```
Step 1 → Complete PR #455  (finish TACC sub-lib reorg + QoL + UX grouping)
           → merge epic/v3--reorg into epic/v3

Step 2 → Complete PR #456  (un-pause tokens, verify build integration)
           → merge epic/v3--gh-345-tokens-from-figma into epic/v3

Step 3 → Complete PR #454  (finalize description, verify full build)
           → merge epic/v3 into main
```

Steps 1 and 2 touch different files and can run in parallel if desired.
Step 3 must come last.

## PR #455 — Reorganize Styles per Client Library

**Branch:** `epic/v3--reorg`  **Base:** `epic/v3`

### What it does

Moves every pattern into a per-library subdirectory that mirrors the client
library's own organization. Each pattern gets its own named folder containing
its source, template, config, and demo styles — co-located.

**Reference: a finished item** (`tacc/components/c-button/`):

```
tacc/components/c-button/
  c-button.postcss         ← source (moved inside the subdir, not flat)
  c-button--cms.postcss    ← variant source (also inside subdir)
  c-button.hbs             ← Fractal template
  c-button.selectors.postcss
  config.yml               ← includes context.subdir (see below)
  demo.css                 ← demo-context styles
```

`config.yml` for a finished item includes:
```yaml
context:
  subdir: "tacc/components/c-button"
```

The `subdir` value is the path from `src/lib/_imports/` to the pattern folder.

### Done ✅

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Bootstrap 3 | ✅ fully reorganized |
| Bootstrap 4 | ✅ fully reorganized |
| Bootstrap 5 | ✅ fully reorganized |
| Django CMS variants (`djangocms-*`) | ✅ moved to own dirs |
| Docs libs (`mkdocs`, `pymdownx`, `python-markdown`, `readthedocs`, `tacc-docs`) | ✅ moved |
| TACC / `components/` | ✅ fully reorganized |

### Remaining ❌

#### 1. TACC sub-libraries — per-item reorganization

Six sub-libraries still need each of their patterns to be reorganized.
Apply the same 3-step pattern used for `tacc/components/` to each item in:

| Sub-library | Path |
|-------------|------|
| elements | `src/lib/_imports/tacc/elements/` |
| generics | `src/lib/_imports/tacc/generics/` |
| objects | `src/lib/_imports/tacc/objects/` |
| settings | `src/lib/_imports/tacc/settings/` |
| tools | `src/lib/_imports/tacc/tools/` |
| trumps | `src/lib/_imports/tacc/trumps/` |

**The 3-step pattern per item** (where `{lib}` = e.g. `elements`, `{item}` = e.g. `links`):

**Step A — Move source into subdir**
```
tacc/{lib}/{item}.postcss         → tacc/{lib}/{item}/{item}.postcss
tacc/{lib}/{item}--variant.postcss → tacc/{lib}/{item}/{item}--variant.postcss
tacc/{lib}/{item}.selectors.postcss → tacc/{lib}/{item}/{item}.selectors.postcss
```
(All `.postcss` files that belong to this item move together.)

**Step B — Add `context.subdir` to the item's `config.yml`**
```yaml
context:
  subdir: "tacc/{lib}/{item}"
```
If the item does not yet have a `config.yml`, create one with at minimum:
```yaml
context:
  subdir: "tacc/{lib}/{item}"
```

**Step C — Remove the `(CMS|…)` prefix from the Fractal label**

In `config.yml` or variant `label:` fields:
```yaml
# Before:
label: (CMS) Links
# After:
label: Links
```

> **Note:** Some patterns have multiple `.postcss` files (e.g. `root.postcss`,
> `root--cms.postcss`, `root--portal.postcss`). All variants belong inside the
> same subdir alongside the main file. The subdir name should be the
> "base name" without the variant suffix (e.g. `root/`).

> **Note:** Some items (e.g. `_elements.config.yml`, `demo.postcss`,
> `README.css`, `selectors.*.postcss`) are infrastructure files, not patterns.
> Do not create subdirs for them.

#### 2. Quality-of-life — absolute imports

- **Support absolute imports:** Update the PostCSS config / build tooling so
  `@import` paths can be written relative to `src/lib/_imports/` (or repo root)
  rather than relative to the current file.
- **Use absolute imports:** Once supported, rewrite all relative `@import`
  paths across all `.postcss` source files to use absolute paths.

  This makes future reorganization much safer (no broken relative paths).

#### 3. UX — Fractal sidebar grouping

Group related libraries in the Fractal demo sidebar:

| Current labels | Target group label |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5 | **Bootstrap** |
| Django CMS Blog, Django CMS Forms, Django CMS Picture | **Django CMS** |
| MkDocs, PyMdown, Python-Markdown, ReadTheDocs, TACC Docs | **Styles for Docs** |

This is configured in `fractality.config.js` and/or the relevant `config.yml`
files.

### Testing

1. `npm start` — launch the Fractal dev server
2. Open every pattern in the sidebar — confirm all render correctly
3. Verify sidebar organization mirrors the client library's own docs:
   - [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/)
   - [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/)
   - [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/)
   - [TACC v2 reference](https://github.com/TACC/Core-Styles/tree/v2.39.0/src/lib/_imports)
4. No regressions — styles should look identical to before the reorg

## PR #456 — Use Re-brand Colors from Figma

**Branch:** `epic/v3--gh-345-tokens-from-figma`  **Base:** `epic/v3`  
**Label:** paused  **Completes:** [issue #457](https://github.com/TACC/Core-Styles/issues/457)

### What it does

Adds CSS custom-property design tokens from TACC's Figma re-brand. All token
files live under `src/v3/variables/`.

**New files:**
```
src/v3/variables/tokens/
  primitives-designsafe.css    ← concrete color values for DesignSafe
  primitives-tacc-cms.css      ← concrete color values for TACC CMS
  primitives-tacc-portal.css   ← concrete color values for TACC Portal
  tokens-dark.css              ← semantic aliases (dark theme)
  tokens-light.css             ← semantic aliases (light theme)
src/v3/variables/
  designsafe.dark.css / designsafe.light.css
  tacc-cms.dark.css / tacc-cms.light.css
  tacc-portal.dark.css / tacc-portal.light.css
```

**Token structure (two layers):**
- **Primitives** — concrete values per product  
  e.g. `--color-traffic-red-normal: #e03535`
- **Semantics** — intent-to-primitive aliases  
  e.g. `--color-danger-normal: var(--color-traffic-red-normal)`

### Remaining ❌

1. **Confirm token values** — verify the manually-entered Figma values are
   current against the latest Figma re-brand spec.
2. **Verify build integration** — confirm the token files are imported by the
   main build entry points in `epic/v3` (they currently live under `src/v3/`,
   which may or may not be included in the main build yet).
3. **Fill in the Testing section** of the PR description (currently `1. …`).
4. **Remove the `paused` label** and mark as ready for review.

### Testing

- Build the full stylesheet (`npm run build`) and confirm no errors.
- Open a pattern in Fractal that uses a semantic color variable (e.g. a danger
  state) and confirm the re-brand color is applied.

## PR #454 — Refactor: v3 (Epic / Umbrella)

**Branch:** `epic/v3`  **Base:** `main`

### What it does

This is the base branch all other v3 work merges into. Key changes already in place:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `.css` → `.postcss` | All source files renamed; built `.css` output is never confused with source |
| No committed `/dist` | Build output is generated-only; never committed |
| `bin/build-each.js` | Builds individual stylesheets in place |
| `bin/only-commit-source.js` | Lint guard: errors if compiled `.css` is found inside `src/` |
| CI lint workflow | Enforces the above on every push |
| `3.0.0-alpha.0` | Version bump |

**Backwards-compatibility:**
- Styles: ✅ backwards-compatible
- Directory structure of `/dist`: ❌ breaking change
- Source file extensions (`.postcss`): ❌ breaking change

### Remaining ❌

1. **Wait for #455 and #456** to be merged into `epic/v3`.
2. **Sync** `epic/v3` with `main` one final time before merging.
3. **Fill in** the PR description's `Changes`, `Testing`, and `UI` sections.
4. **Verify full build** passes: `npm run build && npm run lint`.
5. **Remove draft status** and request review.

### Testing

```sh
npm run lint       # must pass (no compiled .css in src/)
npm run build      # must complete without errors
npm start          # demo server must start and show all patterns
```

---

## Notes

### The `only-commit-source.js` guard

`bin/only-commit-source.js` runs as `prepublishOnly` (and via `npm run lint`).
It walks `src/` and errors if it finds any `.css` file that looks like an
accidentally-committed build artifact.

**What it flags:** every `.css` file in `src/` that is not explicitly ignored.

**What it ignores** (four rules, all must-be-ignored to not flag):

| Rule | Pattern | Examples |
|------|---------|---------|
| 3-segment depth | `_imports/{A}/{B}/{file}.css` | `bootstrap4/components/btn.css`, `bootstrap5/utilities/link.css` |
| Fractal server | `fractal.server.refresh.css` | (build-time temp file) |
| Vendors dir | any path containing `_imports/vendors` | (third-party vendored CSS) |
| README files | any file named `README.css` | `tacc/components/README.css` |

**The 3-segment rule in plain English:**

> If a `.css` file lives exactly two directories below `_imports/`, leave it alone.

This was written to cover the files in the already-reorganized Bootstrap/third-party
libraries: `bootstrap4/components/btn.css`, `color-text.css`, etc. These are
source files that legitimately use `.css` extension in the new library-organized
structure. It is a depth heuristic, not a semantic "compiled vs source" check.

**What the guard does NOT cover (and would flag):**

- **Depth-1 entry points** like `core-styles.bootstrap4.css` and
  `core-styles.bootstrap5.css` — these are the consumer-facing aggregator files
  that clients `@import` to load a library's styles. They are supposed to be
  published. The script predates them (written Oct 2024; both files arrived via
  `main` merges in 2025–2026) and was never updated to allow them. The guard
  needs a new ignore rule for top-level `core-styles.*.css` entry points.
- **Depth-4+ `demo.css` files** inside pattern subdirectories —
  e.g. `tacc/components/c-button/demo.css`, `bootstrap4/components/btn/demo.css`.
  These are small plain-CSS demo-context helpers committed alongside their
  pattern. They are not meant to be published; the guard treating them as
  suspicious is arguably correct, but the right resolution is unclear until the
  full build pipeline for v3 is defined (generate them at build time? commit
  them as `.postcss`?).

On `epic/v3--reorg` there are currently ~54 such `.css` files that the guard
would flag. They do not break CI (no lint workflow runs on push) but they
**would** break `npm publish`. Resolving them — at minimum fixing the
`core-styles.*.css` entry-point gap — is required before v3 can ship.

New features merged from `main` into `epic/v3` may bring in `.css` source
files that still need attention. Check with `npm run lint` after any merge.

### Ghost directories on `epic/v3--reorg`

`src/lib/_imports/objects/o-offset-content/` has a `config.yml`, `.hbs`, and
`readme.md` (added by a recent main merge) but no `.postcss` source. The
source lives at `tacc/objects/o-offset-content.postcss`. This directory is a
leftover from the pre-reorg state and should be cleaned up as part of the
objects reorganization in PR #455.
